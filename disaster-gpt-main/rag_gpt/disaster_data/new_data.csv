"JAKARTA: Roads turned to murky brown rivers, homes were swept away by strong currents and bodies were pulled from mud during deadly flash floods and landslides after torrential rains hit West Sumatra in early March, marking one of the latest deadly natural disasters in Indonesia. Government officials blamed the floods on heavy rainfall, but environmental groups have cited the disaster as the latest example of deforestation and environmental degradation intensifying the effects of severe weather across Indonesia.  ""This disaster occurred not only because of extreme weather factors, but because of the ecological crisis,"" Indonesian environmental rights group Indonesian Forum for the Environment wrote in a statement. ""If the environment continues to be ignored, then we will continue to reap ecological disasters."" A vast tropical archipelago stretching across the equator, Indonesia is home to the world's third-largest rainforest, with a variety of endangered wildlife and plants, including orangutans, elephants, giant and blooming forest flowers. Some live nowhere else. For generations the forests have also provided livelihoods, food, and medicine while playing a central role in cultural practices for millions of Indigenous residents in Indonesia. Since 1950, more than 74 million hectares (285,715 square miles) of Indonesian rainforest - an area twice the size of Germany - have been logged, burned or degraded for development of palm oil, paper and rubber plantations, mining and other commodities according to Global Forest Watch.  Indonesia is the biggest producer of palm oil, one of the largest exporters of coal and a top producer of pulp for paper. It also exports oil and gas, rubber, tin and other resources. And it also has the world's largest reserves of nickel - a critical material for electric vehicles, solar panels and other goods needed for the green energy transition. Indonesia has consistently ranked as one of the largest global emitters of plant-warming greenhouse gases, with its emissions stemming from the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation and peatland fires, according to the Global Carbon Project. It's also highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, including extreme events such as floods and droughts, long-term changes from sea level rise, shifts in rainfall patterns and increasing temperatures, according to the World Bank. In recent decades the country has already seen the effects of climate change: More intense rains, landslides and floods during rainy season, and more fires during a longer dry season. But forests can help play a vital role in reducing the impact of some extreme weather events, said Aida Greenbury, a sustainability expert focusing on Indonesia.  Flooding can be slowed by trees and vegetation soaking up rainwater and reducing erosion. In dry season, forests release moisture that helps mitigate the effects of droughts, including fires. But when forests diminish, those benefits do as well. A 2017 study reported that forest conversion and deforestation expose bare soil to rainfall, causing soil erosion. Frequent harvesting activities - such as done on palm oil plantations - and the removal of ground vegetation leads to further soil compaction, causing rain to run off the surface instead of entering groundwater reservoirs. Downstream erosion also increases sediment in rivers, making rivers shallower and increasing flood risks, according to the research.  After the deadly floods in Sumatra in early March, West Sumatra Gov. Mahyeldi Ansharullah said there were strong indications of illegal logging around locations affected by floods and landslides. That, coupled with extreme rainfall, inadequate drainage systems and improper housing development contributed to the disaster, he said. Experts and environmental activists have pointed to deforestation worsening disasters in other regions of Indonesia as well: In 2021 environmental activists partially blamed deadly floods in Kalimantan on environmental degradation caused by large-scale mining and palm oil operations. In Papua, deforestation was partially blamed for floods and landslides that killed over a hundred people in 2019.  There have been some signs of progress: In 2018 Indonesian President Joko Widodo put a three-year freeze on new permits for palm oil plantations. And the rate of deforestation slowed between 2021-2022, according to government data. But experts warn that it's unlikely deforestation in Indonesia will stop anytime soon as the government continues to move forward with new mining and infrastructure projects such as new nickel smelters and cement factories. ""A lot of land use and land-based investment permits have already been given to businesses, and a lot of these areas are already prone to disasters,"" said Arie Rompas, an Indonesia-based forestry expert at Greenpeace.  President-elect Prabowo Subianto, who is scheduled to take office in October, has promised to continue Widodo's policy of development, include large-scale food estates, mining and other infrastructure development that are all linked to deforestation.  Environmental watchdogs also warn that environmental protections in Indonesia are weakening, including the passing of the controversial Omnibus Law, which eliminated an article of the Forestry Law regarding the minimum area of forest that must be maintained at development projects. ""The removal of that article makes us very worried (about deforestation) for the years to come,"" said Rompas. While experts and activists recognize that development is essential for Indonesia's economy to continue to go, they argue that it should be done in a way that considers the environment and incorporates better land planning.  ""We can't continue down the same path we've been on,"" said sustainability expert Greenbury. ""We need to make sure that the soil, the land in the forest doesn't become extinct."""

"BENGALURU: Karnataka govt on Saturday moved the Supreme Court seeking a direction to the Centre to release drought relief funds to the state under Natural Disaster Management Act (NDMA). The writ petition filed under Article 32 of the Constitution is scheduled for a hearing next week.""We are forced to wage a legal battle after waiting for five months.Farmers are under severe stress due to the drought and are demanding subsidies. Govt must release a Rs 4,600-crore input subsidy, and we are waiting for a Rs 18,171-crore compensation package under the National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF),"" chief minister Siddaramaiah said.He accused the Centre of breaching provisions of the NDMA. ""The state govt presented its initial memorandum in September 2023, and an inter-ministerial central team conducted its visit in the first week of October 2023. We received information that the team submitted its report on October 20. Despite numerous meetings with the PM and other Union ministers, no funds have been released,"" said the CM.When questioned about the petition's locus, the CM asserted that the Centre's violation of a law enacted by Parliament provides the state govt with a ""cause for action"".According to NDMA, the CM said, the centre is mandated to dispatch an inter-ministerial central team to drought-affected states within a week of receiving a memorandum requesting drought relief funds, and it is obligated to release the funds within a month of the IMCT submitting its report."
"Google says that its AI has successfully predicted riverine floods up to seven days in advance, providing reliable forecasting to residents in 80 countries. The findings were published in the science journal ""Nature"", which highlighted the potential of machine learning in addressing one of the world's most common natural disasters.Google's AI-powered approach has significantly improved the reliability of global flood forecasts, extending the average prediction time from zero to five days.The company trained machine learning models with historical events, river level readings, elevation, terrain data, and more, generating localised maps and running hundreds of thousands of simulations for each location. This comprehensive approach enabled the models to accurately predict upcoming floods, even in regions with limited data.The technology has been particularly impactful in underrepresented regions, such as parts of Africa and Asia, where flood forecasting has traditionally been challenging due to the lack of streamflow gauges in most rivers. Google's AI has overcome this obstacle by leveraging available data and applying the machine learning model to basins where data was not available.With a total population of 460 million across 80 countries, Google has made these flood forecasts accessible through various platforms, including Google Search, Google Maps, Android notifications, and the company's proprietary Flood Hub web app, which began operations in 2022.Looking to the future, Google plans to continue exploring the potential of machine learning in creating better flood forecasting models. The company has partnered with academic researchers to fine-tune the AI-driven approach, with the ultimate goal of developing a global end-to-end flood forecasting platform."
"BENGALURU: A new approach by researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) seeks to use multiple swarms of drones to tackle natural disasters like forest fires. Forest fires are becoming increasingly catastrophic across the world, accelerated by climate change, it was noted. ""A swarm of drones could be the solution,"" says Suresh Sundaram, professor in the department of aerospace engineering, IISc.Although they have not yet been used in India, the use of drones is not entirely new, according to a press release issued by the Bengaluru-based IISc. But in a new study, Sundaram's team proposes taking the technology a step further: Coordinated multi-swarm drones swooping in to quell forest fires. ""By the time somebody identifies and reports a fire, it has already started spreading and cannot be put out with one drone,"" says Sundaram. ""You need to have a swarm of drones. A swarm that can communicate with each other."" The solution was to design a special kind of algorithm that would allow the swarm to communicate with each other as well as make independent decisions. In a hypothetical scenario, when an alarm is raised about a potential fire, the swarms can be sent in, each drone armed with cameras, thermal and infrared sensors, and temperature detectors, to spot the fires. Once the fire is discovered, the drone closest to it becomes the centre of the swarm and attracts others towards it. Interestingly, each drone will also have autonomy to calculate the fire's size and potential spread, and decide how many drones are needed to quench the fire. ""These decisions are made by the drones,"" says Sundaram. ""They figure out which cluster of fire is going to spread faster, and allocate the required number of drones to put out that fire while the others look for other fire clusters."" The swarm-based search algorithm developed by the team is key to controlling the drones' behaviour, the release said. Searching for fire cannot be random as the area to explore would be too large. To address this, the researchers took inspiration from the foraging behaviour of a marine predator, a flagellum called Oxyrrhis marina. ""When foraging, it firsts take longer steps to explore the area. Once it feels like it is closer to the food source, it will reduce the step length and then start exploring the area in more detail,"" explains Josy John, PhD student at the Department of Aerospace Engineering, and lead author of the study published in IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems.The team decided to incorporate this behaviour into their algorithm. ""The temperature sensors in the drones look for a minimum (threshold) value. When that is reached, the drones reduce their search step, because the fire is near,"" John adds. The advantage of using drones, Sundaram points out, is that the decision-making is decentralised, based on data, and aimed at maximum efficiency. No more than the required number of drones will be assigned to a fire cluster, allowing others to fan out in search of other clusters. The researchers have tested specific components of the approach, such as the AI-enabled fire detection using thermal cameras, and accurate payload drop mechanism for fire extinguisher deployment. Full-scale search and mitigation by the swarm is yet to undergo field-testing. Going forward, they plan to combine such drone swarms with unmanned ground vehicles that can carry resources and serve as refuelling stations, the release said. Such drone swarms can also be helpful during other natural disasters like floods and earthquakes, to locate survivors, deliver water, food and medicines; and boost communication, it was noted."
"Bhubaneswar: BJD Rajya Sabha member Manas Mangaraj on Tuesday demanded the Centre to declare lightning as “natural disaster”.Raising the issue during zero hour in the Upper House, the MP said given the high mortality rate from lightning, particularly in rural areas, and its impact on families, it is high time the Centre declares it as natural disaster and takes urgent steps.“This declaration would enhance ex gratia support for affected families, offering much-needed relief to thousands of Indians annually. This urgent step must be taken to address the high mortality rate associated with lightning strikes,” he said.Odisha declared lightning a “state-specific disaster” on April 1, 2015, providing Rs 4 lakh ex gratia to the next of kin of the deceased.Quoting India Meteorological Department (IMD) data, Mangaraj said lightning strikes claim lives of 2,500 people annually in India, causing burns, muscle spasms, multi-system dysfunction, cardiac arrest and instant death. “The majority of victims (96%) are from rural areas, including farmers, cattle grazers, fishermen, jungle hunters and labourers working outdoors. Studies indicate that lightning strikes will increase by about 12% for every degree rise in the global average air temperature,” he said.He pointed out that Odisha, as per the last annual lightning report, records the highest number of lightning strikes. Despite this, the state has successfully reduced lightning-related casualties from 207 in 2019-20 to 156 in 2020-2021."
"New Delhi: Dubbing the increasing number of natural disasters like landslides in border states along the frontier with China as “a national security issue”, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday said India will seek cooperation from friendly countries to rule out the role of any “adversary” in them.“Climate change is not just a weather-related phenomenon, but a serious issue related to national security,” Singh said, while inaugurating 29 bridges and six roads constructed by the BRO across seven states and UTs at a cost of Rs 670 crore.“The defence ministry is taking it very seriously and will seek help from friendly countries to study the matter and rule out involvement of our adversaries on this issue,” he said, at the ceremony organised at Joshimath-Malari road in Uttarakhand.While he did not directly name or blame China for triggering landslides, he said certain border states like Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and UTs like Ladakh “have noticed an increase in the number of natural disasters” in recent years. “The Himalayas extend to other states as well.

"WASHINGTON: Anyone who has lived through a natural disaster and then applied to the federal government for assistance knows that it can be a lengthy, frustrating and bureaucratic process. New rules announced Friday by the federal agency in charge of emergency management aim to simplify and speed up the process. With natural disasters now affecting more people across the United States, insurance markets in many states are buckling under the weight of payouts to those hit by wildfires and hurricanes.  Deanne Criswell, who heads the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said the changes, going into effect in March, are designed to make it easier for disaster survivors to get help - a challenge for those often struggling to recover from the worst day of their lives. ""Mother Nature is not letting up,"" Criswell said to reporters on a call announcing the changes. ""We need to be better prepared and better informed to recover from natural disasters faster and more effectively.""  Criswell described the changes as the ""most comprehensive update to our individual assistance program in 20 years."" She said the changes were the result of a huge amount of feedback from survivors, organizations that work in disaster recovery, and elected officials.Here are some of the changes outlined by FEMA:Under previous rules, homeowners who had received payments from their insurance company for home repairs but not enough to cover all of the damage were essentially out of luck when it came to getting help from Fema. Now those homeowners can apply to FEMA for help. Criswell gave an example of a homeowner who has $80,000 in damage but receives only $45,000 from the insurance company. Previously, Fema couldn't help them because their insurance payout already exceeded the agency's assistance cap of $42,500 per disaster. Now, that homeowner can get money from the agency to make up the difference. This rule change comes at a time when homeowners in places like Louisiana, Florida and California are facing skyrocketing deductibles and fights with insurance companies over damage assessments that have made it difficult even for people with insurance to recover from hurricanes or wildfires. Samantha L Montano, an assistant professor of emergency management at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, called this change a ""pretty massive internal shift"" and questioned why it hadn't been done before. She said survivors are increasingly receiving estimates from insurance companies that are much lower than the cost of repairs or inspectors saying that the damage was pre-existing and as such not covered. That leaves homeowners increasingly in the position that they have to sue their insurance company or figure out how to make up the difference on their own. ""Very often homeowners are in kind of this state of limbo where, yeah, 'I have $30,000 sitting in the bank, but I need $50,000 to even begin to be able to start this work,'"" she said.Under previous rules, disaster survivors first had to apply for a loan with the Small Business Administration and get rejected before they could apply for FEMA assistance. Criswell said survivors found the SBA application requirement ""confusing and challenging,"" so the agency is eliminating that requirement. Al Cathey, who was mayor of Mexico Beach, Florida, when Hurricane Michael leveled almost every building in the Panhandle beach town in 2018, said he welcomed the changes given the bureaucracy and paperwork he encountered when he went to apply for an SBA loan for his destroyed hardware store. After going to a trailer where SBA workers handed him a large packet of papers, and seeing how many people he would have to be interviewed by to get the loan, he decided it wasn't worth it even though he was about $200,000 short of the money needed to reopen the store. ""I got frustrated with them myself. I didn't want to get involved with all that government red tape,"" Cathey said Friday. ""I understand the need for guidelines and policies, but, my God, the paperwork they wanted from me to start the approval process. This was a disaster, but you would think they thought I wanted the money for a vacation.""The agency has had something called critical needs assistance, currently $750, that survivors can use for whatever they need right after a disaster: baby formula or food, for example. But states or tribal nations had to specifically request that category of assistance, and it was only done on a case-by-case basis. Now, anytime a disaster is declared that includes FEMA's individual assistance funding stream, those $750 payments will be available. Survivors still have to apply, and there is some vetting to prevent fraud. But it bypasses the application that states and tribal nations had to make. That doesn't mean that every disaster will include these payments. Many declared disasters are more limited in scope.Disaster survivors with disabilities can use FEMA money to make changes to their homes to make them more accessible, whereas under previous rules the agency would only pay to rebuild things that had been damaged in the disaster. People with pre-existing problems in their home, like a leaky roof, can now get money from the agency to fix the house. Currently, the agency requires that if it is giving people money to fix something, it had to have worked before the disaster.  And FEMA is creating a new category of aid called displacement assistance, designed to help those who can't return to their home. It gives them money for housing while they're looking for a long-term rental and has flexibility so that they can, for example, use the money to pay a friend's utilities if they're crashing on a couch. Montano, the disaster researcher, also lauded the changes to how the agency treats people whose homes already had some damage before a storm, calling that a ""massive change"" in how the agency operates. Overall, she said, these are all ""good and needed changes, but we still need to do more."" Like any new government policy, it depends on how things play out once the policies go into effect. And, she said, there's likely still room to improve things like the appeal process or giving survivors more time to apply for aid. And, she noted, FEMA is one part - albeit an important part - of disaster recovery. She said Congress needs to step in to increase the cap on individual assistance to disaster survivors and there needs to be more oversight of the insurance industry.  The new rules go into effect March 22. The changes are expected to cost $671 million per year, with $159 million of that borne by the states and tribal nations where the disasters occur."
"Dharamshala: Chief minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu through a special statement in the assembly on Wednesday stated that he was not expecting a special package from the central government to deal with the natural disaster in the state.He said the BJP MPs from the state were afraid of meeting the Prime Minister and the Union home minister. Sukhu said he would meet them on the issue in the last week of December, if they wish, and BJP leaders could also accompany him.Countering the remarks made by the CM, leader of opposition Jai Ram Thakur said as far as the BJP leaders and MPs meeting the central leaders was concerned, they had continuously advocated for the state at their level, but the government also had some responsibility.The former CM said had the central government not helped in relief and rescue works, the situation in the state would have turned even worse.Sukhu, meanwhile, said over 500 precious lives had been lost due to the disaster in the monsoon season, which was impossible to compensate for. Apart from this, the state has suffered a loss of Rs 9,905 crore due to the disaster, the assessment of which was sent to the Government of India on September 23 this year.He said on September 16, Rs 200 crore was released as interim relief from the National Disaster Response Fund by the Government of India. If the central government released the relief amount even on the basis of minimum rates based on the assessment of loss, it should have been Rs 1,658 crore, but only Rs 633.73 crore was sanctioned to the state on December 19, out of which Rs 200 crore was already received as interim relief.Sukhu said the financial assistance received for damages caused by rain in the previous few years was compared to this year – in 2018-19, for the loss of Rs 2,099.42 crore, the state had received Rs 396.89 crore; in the year 2019-20, for the loss of Rs 1,551.26 crore, Himachal received Rs 348.46; in the year 2020-21, for the loss of Rs 865.19 crore, the state had received Rs 120.21 crore.He said in the year 2023-24, against the loss of Rs 9,905.77 crore, only Rs 633.73 crore had been received, which was only 6.40%. The state government was expecting a financial assistance of Rs 2,000 crore and the assembly had also passed a resolution in this regard, he said. Despite this, the relief amount was not sanctioned to the state as per the criteria, Sukhu alleged.BJP MLAs raised objections to the statement given by the chief minister in the assembly and there was an argument between the MLAs of the ruling party and the opposition. The BJP MLAs said the CM’s statement was not based on facts. Jai Ram Thakur objected to the Sukhu’s statement and said those who took a loan of Rs 12,000 crore within a year were trying to project themselves as helpless.Seeing the Lok Sabha elections approaching, the entire blame is being put on the central government, said Thakur. The truth is that the Centre has provided generous financial help, but not even a word of thanks is coming out of the mouth of Congress leaders, he added.The BJP leader said this way, the ruling party leaders would eliminate any possibility of getting help from the Centre in future."

"OSO: After the mountainside collapsed, obliterating a neighborhood and 43 lives in the worst landslide disaster in U.S. history, Jessica Pzsonka made a promise -– to herself, to her bereft parents and to her late sister, who was buried along with two young sons, her husband and in-laws.Pszonka would see a permanent memorial created where relatives and visitors could feel her sister’s presence and reflect on the serenity that drew the family to Oso, as well as the forces that left an immense scar in the forested Cascade Mountain foothills along the north fork of the Stillaguamish River, 55 miles (89 km) northeast of Seattle.Ten years later, that memorial is complete, and Pszonka is leaving: She put her home up for sale and is moving, with her parents, to Texas.“I need to get them out of here,” she said. “They cannot snap out of it. It’s like it happened yesterday, every day, when they drive by the school that the kids would have gone to.”The trauma that engulfed Oso, a rural community of a couple hundred residents, on March 22, 2014, was a national wake-up call about the dangers of landslides. Washington state began hiring more staff and conducting more mapping to get a better handle on the risk, and it tightened guidelines on logging landslide-prone slopes amid concerns that clearcutting near the top of the scar might have helped cause the disaster.Congress in 2020 adopted the National Landslides Preparedness Act to create a national strategy to identify, understand and protect against landslides — legislation pushed by lawmakers from Washington state, including Democratic Rep. Suzan DelBene.“It was really hard for anyone to imagine how enormous the impact was — that you really had to be there to see that this side of a mountain collapsed into the valley and up the other side, wiping out an entire community,” DelBene said. “I personally wanted to do anything I could to make sure that a natural disaster like this did not become another national tragedy.”Nevertheless, landslides are likely to afflict more and more people as climate change intensifies storms and wildfires, destabilizing soil. Predicting slides remains difficult, though some research projects have helped establish under what conditions certain types might occur.In the years since Oso, post-wildfire landslides have become alarmingly frequent in California, where mudslides killed 23 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Montecito in 2018.More than 500 mudslides were recorded in Los Angeles alone after torrential downpours early this year; another destroyed a home last week.Areas that have not burned have also suffered, such as the mountainous temperate rainforest of southeast Alaska, which has seen three deadly landslides on saturated slopes since 2015. The most recent killed six people in Wrangell last November.Landslides occur throughout the U.S., including in the Southeast after hurricanes. But Brian Collins, a research civil engineer with the U.S. Geological Survey who helped study the Oso slide, noted that in the “steeper terrain of the Western U.S. and Alaska, they do tend to be and — as we’re seeing — there have been ... certainly a number of devastating landslides in the past 10 years.”None more so than Oso. It was 10:37 on a sunny Saturday morning following weeks of heavy rain when the hillside gave way in a scraping, crashing roar — some residents thought it was the Navy jets that often fly overhead. Some 19 million tons of sand and ancient glacial deposits — enough to cover 700 football fields 10 feet (3 meters) deep — raced across the river at an average speed of 40 mph (64 kph), hydroplaning on the saturated valley floor “kind of like an air hockey table,” Collins said.The tsunami of sodden earth and pulverized timber slammed into Steelhead Haven, a subdivision of 35 homes. The highway running alongside was buried 20 feet (6.1 meters) deep.There had been a history of landslides on the slope, including massive prehistoric slides. One in 2006 dammed the river, and before that, technical reports had warned about a potential “large catastrophic failure” and ""significant risk to human lives and private property.” Officials considered buying up homes in the area to keep people out.But even those reports did not suggest anything could happen on the order of what did occur. Residents said they had no idea of the danger; homes continued being built even after the 2006 slide. Washington state and the company that logged above the slope paid more than $70 million to settle lawsuits by the 2014 slide's victims and their families.It was the deadliest landslide in U.S. history, according to the National Science Foundation-backed geotechnical team that reviewed it. Nine people survived — including a mother and baby who were reunited in a hospital two weeks later.Tim Ward lost his wife of 37 years, Brandy, and four of his five dogs. He described regaining consciousness 500 yards (457 meters) from where his house once stood, in a hole 15 feet (4.6 meters) deep, with an opening at the top the size of a kitchen saucer. Rescuers eventually pulled him out.Many of the victims — retirees, grandparents, military veterans, office workers, young families — were simply at home on a weekend. Others just happened to be there: three contractors working on a house. Someone installing a satellite TV dish. A plumber servicing a hot-water tank.Summer Raffo, 36, was driving on State Route 530 on her way to shoe a horse for a client. Seconds earlier or later, she would have been fine. Instead, the slide buried her, ripping the roof off her blue Subaru.Raffo's older brother, Dayn Brunner, was a tribal police officer at the time. His mother called him that day and said: “You're her brother. You need to go find her.” He and his teenage sons went past police barricades and spent five days digging through the muck. When searchers finally found Raffo's car, they called Brunner over to lift her body out. Her hands were still on the wheel. The speedometer read 60 mph (97 kmh).In an extraordinary effort, teams that included 900 responders from near and far plus volunteers — firefighters and police, military members and local loggers — helped find every victim, often slogging through what they came to call ""the pile” as rain fell. They would silence their chainsaws and other machinery whenever they discovered bodies. The last victim turned up that July, about three months after the official search ended.Brunner, Pszonka and other family members spent years working on the memorial — holding fundraisers, lobbying lawmakers for money and attending planning committee meetings. They wanted to honor not just the lives lost, but the community response.“We could be standing here and talking about that they never recovered my one nephew, who is one of the last ones” to be found, Pszonka said. “To those firefighters and search and rescue people and rescue dogs and all the people that promised that they would stay until every person was found, I will be forever grateful.”Pszonka's sister and her husband, Katie and Shane Ruthven, had a thriving glass-repair business. The boys, Hunter and Wyatt, ages 6 and 4, loved football. Pszonka and her parents got tattoos to help remember them by. But holidays, birthdays — any days — aren't the same. So they're leaving to get a fresh start, she said.The $3.8 million memorial features large, curved metal panels by Seattle artist Tsovinar Muradyan for each family, with cut-out designs filled with colorful epoxy — butterflies for Pszonka's nephews. Raffo's includes a portrait of her along with her favorite horse.Raffo was quiet and reserved, funny, dependable and an incredibly hard worker, Brunner said.“Ever since Day 3, when the reality set in, I knew that I’m going to explain to everybody how special my sister was to me, to my mom, to my entire family, and let them know who the person she was,” Brunner said. “And doing this memorial is doing that for me."""
"PORT MORESBY: Flooding, landslides and torrential rains have killed at least 23 people in Papua New Guinea's Highlands region, where homes have been damaged and roads washed away.Acting Director for the National Disaster Centre, Lusete Man said a mother and child were among the dead as bad weather hit multiple communities.""The 23 were buried under tons of mud in three separate landslides in different parts of Simbu province,"" Man said on Monday.""We are still experiencing heavy rains, landslips, flooded rivers, that have caused extensive damages in the highlands.""The province, also known as Simbu, is made up of six districts and is home to about 376,000 people. Coastal communities have also been hit, with rising king tides sweeping away seafronts and flooding beachside villages. In the Gulf and Western deltas, rising waters from flooded rivers have caused havoc to communities, their food gardens and livelihoods. The government has allocated 10,000 Papua New Guinean kinas ($2,645) for relief assistance. Nearby Enga province has also experienced heavy flooding. Wapenamanda community leader Aquila Kunzie told RNZ Pacific the community was rationing its food supply. ""Constant continuous rainfall in Wapenamanda district has caused rivers to flood,"" Kunzie said.He added that more than 100 women and children had taken refuge in his village following nearby tribal warfare. ""[We are eating] only one meal per day, we can't afford breakfast and lunch with all of them,"" he said. ""We have no way to call out for help.""A New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesperson told AFP it had not received a request for aid. ""We will be in touch with our diplomatic post in Port Moresby for further detail, and will continue to monitor closely,"" the spokesperson said on Tuesday. Papua New Guinea is ranked as the world's 16th most at-risk country to climate change and natural hazards, according to the 2022 World Risk Index."
"Bengaluru: A new approach by Indian Institute of Science researchers seeks to use multiple swarms of drones to tackle natural disasters like forest fires, which are becoming increasingly catastrophic across the world, accelerated by climate change.“A swarm of drones could be the solution,” said Suresh Sundaram, professor at IISc’s department of aerospace engineering (DAE).Although they haven’t yet been used in India, use of drones is not entirely new. In the study, Sundaram’s team proposes taking the technology a step further: Coordinated multi-swarm drones swooping in to quell forest fires. “By the time somebody identifies and reports a fire, it has already started spreading and cannot be put out with one drone. You need to have a swarm of them; a swarm that can communicate with each other,” Sundaram said.The solution was to design a special algorithm that would allow the swarm to communicate as well as make independent decisions. The closest drone becomes the centre of the swarm and attracts others towards it. Each drone will also have the freedom to calculate the fire’s size and potential spread, and decide how many are needed to douse the flames.“These decisions are made by drones. They figure out which cluster of fire is going to spread faster and allocate the required number of drones to put out that fire while others look for other clusters,” Sundaram explained.The swarm-based search algorithm developed by the team is key to controlling drones’ behaviour, IISc said, adding that searching for fire cannot be random as the area to explore would be too large. To address this, researchers took inspiration from foraging behaviour of a marine predator, a flagellum called Oxyrrhis marina. “When foraging, it first takes longer steps to explore the area. Once it feels like it is closer to the food source, it’ll reduce step length and start exploring the area in more detail,” explained Josy John, PhD student at DAE, and lead author of the study published in IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems. The team decided to incorporate this behaviour into their algorithm. “Temperature sensors in drones look for a minimum [threshold] value. Upon reaching that, they reduce their search step, because the fire is near,” John added.Sundaram said advantages of using drones are: Decision-making is decentralised, based on data, and aimed at maximum efficiency. “No more than the required number of drones will be assigned to a fire cluster, allowing others to fan out in search of other clusters.” “Full-scale search and mitigation by the swarm is yet to undergo field-testing. Going forward, the team plans to combine such drone swarms with unmanned ground vehicles that can carry resources and serve as refuelling stations. Such drone swarms can also be helpful during natural disasters like floods and earthquakes — to locate survivors, deliver water, food and medicines and boost communication,” IISc said."
"Lucknow: A divisional-level workshop on the role of the community, especially women and self-help groups (SHGs), in mitigating the impact of crises and disasters such as gas cylinder blasts or floods was held at Indira Gandhi Pratishthan on Tuesday. Over 350 women from various districts such as Sitapur and Unnao, among others attended the workshop. Presiding over the workshop, district magistrate Surya Pal Gangwar called upon the women representing scores of SHGs that are involved in community-level mobilisation to come forward and be active members in aiding the state to avert and mitigate various disasters and crises. Gangwar underscored the need for self-reliance and awareness of basic precautionary measures to avoid any large-scale loss of human lives during a crisis.“SHGs are already involved in multiple works to make the community self-reliant. They can play a pivotal role in both averting and mitigating disasters. But before that, their capacities need to be enhanced first to understand different types of disasters and then methods and means to avert and mitigate them,” he said. Coining the catchphrase ‘of prevention, precaution, mitigation and preparation, Gangwar gave a cursory view of the role that the SHGs can see themselves undertaking in their respective communities. “Many disasters such as fire in office places due to short-circuits or LPG cylinder blasts can very easily be averted if we are prepared and act swiftly. Likewise, there are many crises like drowning that may not be averted but their severity can be lessened. This workshop aims to build the capacities to identify varied nature of disasters and how to respond to them,” he added."
"REYKJAVIK: No other country than Iceland is better prepared for volcanos and other natural disasters, its prime minister said Saturday, as authorities brace for a potential lava eruption southwest of the capital Reykjavik.The roughly 4,000 residents of Grindavik, a fishing port around 40 kilometres (25 miles) from the capital, were evacuated on November 11 after magma shifting under the Earth's crust caused hundreds of earthquakes -- a warning of a likely volcanic eruption.Thousands of smaller tremors have since shaken the area along the Reykjanes peninsula, with several homes and other structures suffering severe damage.""No country is better prepared for natural disasters than Iceland,"" Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir said at a press conference.""We have long experience in dealing with volcanic eruptions. We know that it's not necessarily a sound decision to build for example defence mechanisms when you have such a great uncertainty where an eruption can come up,"" she said.The Reykjanes peninsula had not experienced an eruption for eight centuries until 2021.Since then, three eruptions have struck -- all in remote uninhabited areas -- and volcanologists say this could be the start of a new era of activity in the region.That has raised the prospect that residents may not be able to return to their homes any time soon.""Our main priority is really to embrace those people, ensure that they have adequate salaries and to find proper housing for them for the next weeks or months,"" Jakobsdottir said.""We have proposed a bill for the parliament to ensure the salaries for the next three months. And we are working as fast as we can to ensure proper housing for those people,"" she said.Iceland is home to 33 active volcano systems, the highest number in Europe, and towns have been hit before.The country has been on edge for the past week, waiting for a potential eruption near Grindavik."
"BATHINDA: The People for Himalaya, a campaign of civil society organisations, social and environmental justice activists, working towards securing the Himalayan region from disasters in an online event released five-point demand charter for dissemination to all political parties in the wake of the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections.“A top down model of development and governance cannot work for the region which has its unique topography, culture and lifestyle”, said Climate activist Sonam Wangchuk who recently concluded his 21 day climate fast in Ladakh, with the demand for statehood and 6th schedule recognition under the constitution.In solidarity with the ongoing struggle in Ladakh, representatives from the Himalayan belt put forth the issue of marginalisation of the Himalayan voices at the national level and the need for Himalayan solidarities to raise the demands around decentralisation and democratisation of decision making for the well-being of mountains and its communities.Mayalmit Lepcha, from Affected Citizens of Teesta, and Mohan Saikia from the North East Dialogue forum expressed serious concerns about the ecological impacts of massive hydropower development proposed on the Bramhaputra and its river basins without the consent of local indigenous communities. “The far reaching impact of these infrastructures are manifested in the form of floods whose impacts go right up to the downstream”, added Saikia.The demand for a complete halt on mega infrastructures like large dams, railway and four lane given the underground invasion and muck generation was also echoed by Guman Singh, from Himalaya Niti Abhiyan and Atul Sati of Joshimath Bachao Sangharsh Samiti.It was stated be it the Beas floods or the land subsidence in Joshimath, these are all not natural disasters but man-made, policy led disasters. The over-all demand for a people not profit centred economic and governance was reiterated.Vimla Vishwapremi of Parvatiya Mahila Adhikar Manch, Himachal and Aman Gujjar from Van Gujjar Tribal Yuva Sangathan Uttarakhand further added that those who contribute least to these policy disasters and the climate crisis are worst impacted - the most marginalised people - be they pastorals, landless Dalits and women. “They remain invisible and lack support when it comes to rebuilding their lives. ‘First we get affected by disasters and then policies like forced plantations on our lands further restrict our rights and livelihoods”, added Aman Gujjar.Anmol Ohri from Climate Front Jammu raised the issue of mindless pilgrim tourism, road construction in glacial regions and the threats from riverfront development projects that will increase the flood risk in the region. The apathy and failure of central institutions in monitoring, regulation and planning was highlighted by Kashmir based writer and researcher Raja Muzaffar Bhatt in the context of the wetland destruction in the region.Wildlife Biologist Tsewang Namgial and glaciologist Smriti Basnett lent their voice to the campaign with their concern for the loss of biodiversity and glacial health in the high Himalaya. “Mountains don’t need this development which is hasty, haughty and haphazard”, said Namgial. Building equitable, sustainable and resilient mountain societies with peace and justice is the way forward and this requires strengthening local livelihood base through fair resource distribution and ownership. The demand charter will also be sent to political parties."
"KOTTAYAM: Mahatma Gandhi University is forming a 4,800-member team of volunteers to meet emergencies during natural disasters. The ‘MGU Team on Spot’ will include NCC cadets and National Service Scheme (NSS) volunteers from its affiliated colleges. It is for the first time that a university in the country is forming a disaster management team of this strength.Cooperatives minister V N Vasavan will inaugurate the initiative on Saturday.The team’s services will be available in Kottayam, Ernakulam, Idukki, Pathanamthitta districts and the eastern part of Alappuzha. The district disaster management authorities, government departments and local bodies can also avail its services.The team will start functioning after training by experts, to be provided in association with the disaster management authority, police, fire and rescue services and health department.NSS coordinator E N Sivadasan said around 3,200 NSS volunteers from 187 colleges in Kottayam, Ernakulam, Pathanamthitta and Idukki districts and 1,600 NCC cadets would be part of the team.“These include 1,500 from Ernakulam, 1,400 from Kottayam, 1,100 from Idukki and 800 from Pathanamthitta. The NSS will be coordinating the activities,” he said.The team will take up disaster management activities based on instructions from government agencies and departments.Its services will be mainly available for taking precautions during disasters, evacuation of people from disaster-prone areas, rescue activities, first aid, managing relief camps, cleaning of contaminated water bodies, rehabilitation, and the like."
"BENGALURU: The thundershowers around midnight on Monday resulted in Bengaluru witnessing its wettest November day since 2015. The city received more than 7cm of rainfall, according to data from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD).The torrential rain resumed on Tuesday and continued to lash the city with the same intensity, with 26.1mm of rainfall recorded until evening.Influenced by the trough running over peninsular India and extending from Lakshadweep in the Arabian Sea to the Bay of Bengal, the prevailing Northeast monsoon gained momentum and resulted in moderate-to-heavy rainfall in the northern and western parts of the city on Monday.IMD sounded a Yellow Alert (for heavy rain) over Bengaluru for the second consecutive day, even as Yelahanka (in the north) received the highest rainfall of 164 mm, while Hampinagar (in the west) received 101.5mm. A Prasad, senior scientist at IMD Bengaluru, said: ""Even though the night-long rain was not a record, it came close to the previous wettest November day since 2015."" On November 4, 2015, the city had witnessed 9cm of rainfall, he added. Monday night's heavy rain resulted in waterlogging in low-lying areas and caused flooding in underpasses in several parts of the city. The five taluks of Bengaluru Urban, which normally receive around 10 mm of rain during this time of the year, received 211.4 mm of rain on Monday, according to data from the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre. Officials at IMD Bengaluru further said the city will continue to witness moderate-to-heavy rain for one more day and the wet spell will subside towards the weekend. ""Bengaluru will witness dry weather from next week and receive its usual quota of rain for the rest of the month,"" Prasad added."
